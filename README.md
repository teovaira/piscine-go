# Piscine-Go (Zone01)

This repo collects my solutions and exercises from the Zone01 Piscine-Go program. It covers fundamental Go topics such as printing, recursion, list operations, maps, ranges, string manipulation, and algorithmic challenges.

## Usage

Each `.go` file is a standalone exercise. To run an exercise:

```bash
go run exercise_name.go
